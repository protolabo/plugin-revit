# First Prototype

This is the **first prototype**, built using **.NET Framework 4.8**.

It allows selecting elements (**walls, doors, windows**) from a Revit model and creates an Ekahau file for WiFi analysis.

To use it, place the **build_files** folder on your desktop.

A file containing information about **walls, windows, and doors** will be created at  
`build_files\build_tools\elements.txt`.

There is still a scale problem between Ekahau and Revit.!!!
